# Claude Code bootstrap for mtg-sim

Read this file first. It tells Claude Code what this repo is, how to navigate it, and which conventions apply.

## What you're looking at

`mtg-sim` is a competitive Magic: The Gathering simulator. Three workflows:

- **Goldfish**: how fast does this deck kill a dummy? (`python sim.py <deck>`)
- **Matchup gauntlet**: how does it fare against the field? (`python bo3_gauntlet.py <deck>`)
- **APL tuning**: propose card swaps, re-sim, report win-rate delta

The engine lives in `engine/` (game state, mana, combat, keywords). The decision layer lives in `apl/` (action priority lists, one file per archetype). Drivers at the repo root (`sim.py`, `run_matchup.py`, etc.) compose the two.

## Navigation priorities

When given a task, load context in this order:

1. `README.md` — overall layout and quick start
2. `CONVENTIONS.md` — ASCII-only terminal output, dual-platform parity, exit codes, env-var config
3. This file for repo-specific status (current APL work, what's known-good, what's in progress)
4. `apl/<deck>.py` for the archetype being discussed
5. `engine/<module>.py` only if the task touches the engine itself

## Cross-project dependency (important)

mtg-sim imports `from scrapers.scryfall import get_cards_data` from the sibling repo `mtg-meta-analyzer`. For code to run, both must be checked out as siblings:

```
dev-dir/
├── mtg-sim/
└── mtg-meta-analyzer/
```

This is the only cross-repo import. Decoupling is tracked as an open issue.

## Conventions you must follow

See `CONVENTIONS.md` and the upstream at https://github.com/Zuxas/claude-harness/blob/main/CONVENTIONS.md. Specifically:

- **Terminal output is ASCII-only.** Em-dashes, arrows, bullets go in file content or comments, not in `print`/`Write-Host`/`info`/`err` calls.
- **APL files** are plain Python modules. Module docstring describes the game plan. Card names are module-level constants (`CARD_NAME = "Exact Oracle Name"`) to avoid string drift.
- **Tests** are stand-alone scripts. Run as `python tests/<name>.py`. They set `sys.path` up to the repo root via `dirname(dirname(abspath(__file__)))`.
- **Scripts** in `scripts/` follow the same path convention. Don't assume cwd.

## Current APL status

### Amulet Titan (Modern) — RULES-CORRECT, validated April 2026

- APL: `apl/amulet_titan.py` (2388 lines, Bible-based combo engine)
- Deck: `decks/amulet_titan_modern.txt` (60+15)
- Goldfish 20 life: 95.7% WR, avg T7.11, median T7
- Realistic 17 life: 95.9% WR, avg T6.81, median T6
- Rules corrections applied:
  1. Sorcery-speed spells can't be cast during combat
  2. Attack trigger fires in main_phase2 (after combat)
  3. Mirrorpool copy ETB: no land plays or haste during combat
  4. Land plays respect land drop limit (1/turn + extras)
  5. Self-return chains require actual remaining drops (not grazer_in_hand)
  6. Self-return replays don't consume extra land drops
- Kill sources: ~90% combat, ~8% Analyst loop, ~2% Scapeshift OHKO

### In progress

- Domain Zoo: P/T propagation bug (power/toughness not flowing through static abilities correctly)
- Deep audit of the 9 basic match APLs (sb_plan_generic) — some are stubs from Gemma, need hand-tuning

### Experimental (auto-generated, mixed quality)

- `apl/experimental/` contains 9 Gemma-generated match APLs for Standard archetypes. Not hand-tuned. WRs range 16–48%. See `apl/experimental/README.md` for disposition guidance. **Do not** recommend these as canonical.
